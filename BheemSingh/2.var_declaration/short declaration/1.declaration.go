package main

// package fmt is for formatted input and output
import "fmt"

func main() {
	//declaration and initialization
	//use of short declaration operator := (only in the func main cannot use this outside func main)
	x := 12
	fmt.Println(x)
	y := 12 + 24
	fmt.Println(y)

}

//feedback: as mentioned in the comment in line 8, make another file where you use this outside func main . It is better to show that through a go program.
